# Hey There :wave:

## This was my third project in REACT!!

In this project, I build off a previous project: San Diego Top Spots.  This time we convert to React and add a container component to tract state and add a seperate stateless component to just render each top spots information

To get started, open the app in VS code, or code editor of your choosing.  Install the necessary dependencies via the terminal by typing 'npm install'. Next, in the terminal, type 'node server/index.js' to start the app on the local node server. Open localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.  

## ENJOY! :thumbsup:
